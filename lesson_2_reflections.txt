What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git creates its own .git dir to store any changes, commits and much more information and 
	metadata to operate and provide its functionality

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area lets you firstly prepare the commit, because it is a little more difficult
	to revert the commit rather than revert adding a file. Also you can add the files 
	consequently as they get ready. It gives you even more control.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Thanks to diff you can overview and compare all the files in the staging area.
	Then you can add some more or remove any if needed to get the logical completeness.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	If the development of a project is threaded, it would be a good decision to have its own
	branch for a thread (e.g. l10n branch and support branch). Also you can always rollback 
	a branch if you understand that a feature will fail.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	It lets you scan a history of project more quickly and make some decisions faster. For 
	example, if you found adding a new feature ended up worse than you expected, you can take 
	one early commit of new branch to create one more and try to improve the situation.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	The result is the one single commit which has all the changes of the previous branches.
	It should be represented so, because new commit has two parent ones and we can roll back
	to any.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
